# Capstone-Project-Winning in NBA



## Project/Goals
The goal of the project is to gather data from different sources and perform data cleaning and EDA to get a dataframe ready for visiualization. Tableau is the primary tool to look for relationships from the dataframe and visualize the outcomes. The analysis serves as a way to demonstrate the process of using data to compare and explore ways to improve business operation. The example used was in the sports industry but similar process can be used in different business setting in solving business problems.

## Process
### Gather data from multiple data sources (https://www.basketball-reference.com/,  Kaggle) and have a basic understanding of what each statistic means.
### Import data in Jupyter notebook and perform data cleaning, combining, and EDA. 
### Export final dataframe and import the result in Tableau for data visualization.
### Visualize data in relation to winning stats and draw insights
### Interpret the result and create Powerpoint slides for results presentation
### Create a dashboard to summarize 

## Results
NBA statistics were chosen for this project because the sports industry has been using statistics to help improve team operation and player performance monitoring. 

All the tables are connected through 'teams' since this analysis focus more on the team level and the league as a whole in terms of performances.

The main areas that the analysis focuses on are offense (points scored by the team) and defense (points allowed to the appoint) and how they affect the wins for each team for the past 5 seasons.

Both offense and defense play a role in contributing to wins as shown in the regression model but what's interesting is that none of the stats that contribute to the offensive and defensive stats is statistically significant in affecting the wins of a team. That means they must all collectively contribute to the respective stats before impacting the winning odds.

Additional analysis are done on the Toronto Raptors in comparison with the league average. It is shown that the Raptors performed poorly in the 2023-2024 season on both offense and defense and therefore they were not competitve enough to get a winning record and end up with only 25 wins for the season.

The results of this analysis can lead to additional follow-up analysis in detail, such as exploring a specific stat in the offensive stats and understanding how each player performs in contribution to it. 

## Challenges 
First is to find data sources and see if the stats are suited for the analysis.
Time constraint is another big challenge. The project was finished within one week, therefore extended analysis was not able to be performed within a tight timeframe.


## Future Goals
Exploration on more in-depth stats to build up more relationship on offensive and defensive stats on a player level is needed to have more options in improving operation. Gathering more historical data and perform analysis from the past can also be done to help in predicting team success.
